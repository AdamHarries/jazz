# Jazz

Scores &amp;cetera for Stompin' At Summerhall.

The latest releases of our "books" can be found here: 

- [Concert pitch (Piano, Guitar, Bass, etc)](https://github.com/AdamHarries/jazz/releases/latest/download/c.pdf)
- [B♭ (Trumpet, Tenor Sax, etc)](https://github.com/AdamHarries/jazz/releases/latest/download/bb.pdf)
- [E♭ (Alto Sax, Baritone Sax, etc)](https://github.com/AdamHarries/jazz/releases/latest/download/eb.pdf)

To read the generated sheet music, check out the releases page of the associated github, or build them yourself!

This is now also dockerised, so if you have docker installed, it should be as easy as running the `run_docker.sh` script to generate pdfs (which should then be copied out of the container).
